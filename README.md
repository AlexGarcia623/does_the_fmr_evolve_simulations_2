# Does the FMR evolve with redshift? II: The Evolution in Normalisation of the Mass-Metallicity Relation

This repo contains the analysis scripts, figures, and data products from the paper Garcia et al. (2024b)

## Contents

### Data:

Contains minimal working example data for generation of the figures associated with this work for Illustris, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations from redshift 0-8 (technically 0-10, though none of 9 and 10 are used in this work).

All credit for simulation data goes to the respective collaborations: see [Illustris](https://www.illustris-project.org/), [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/), [EAGLE](https://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/), and [SIMBA](http://simba.roe.ac.uk/).

### Data Reduction

!!! Not required to run the scripts to generate plots !!!
!!! Is required if you would like to significantly alter selection criteria !!!

Contains scripts used to generate data products from raw simulation data 

### Figures (pdfs)

Contains pdf versions of all figures
